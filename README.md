## About

:earth_africa: [OwlPlug Website](https://owlplug.com) | :pushpin: [Roadmap](https://owlplug.com/roadmap) | :page_facing_up: [Documentation](https://github.com/Dropsnorz/OwlPlug/wiki)

OwlPlug is an open-source plugin manager designed to simplify the installation, discovery, and management of audio plugins.
It was born out of frustration with the tedious process of installing and organizing plugins. Inspired by dependency managers and online content stores, OwlPlug offers a seamless way to manage your audio tools while also helping you discover new plugins from the community.
All feedback, contributions, and suggestions are warmly welcomed.

# Installation

## Direct Download

### Requirements
- Windows 7 (64-bit) or later
- macOS Ventura or later
- Linux with `.deb` package support

### Installation Steps
1. Download the installer for your platform from the [Releases](http://github.com/dropsnorz/owlplug/releases) page.
   - Windows: `.msi` installer
   - macOS: `.dmg` file
   - Linux: `.deb` package
2. Run the installer.
3. Launch OwlPlug.

‚ö†Ô∏è **macOS Users**: On some versions of macOS, you may see a warning that OwlPlug is damaged. This can be fixed by following the instructions on the [Troubleshooting wiki page](https://github.com/DropSnorz/OwlPlug/wiki/Troubleshooting). This issue occurs because the app is not notarized by Apple.

## Package Managers

### Windows

```sh
winget install --exact --id=OwlPlug.OwlPlug
```

# Features

## Plugins discovery

OwlPlug can discover VST2, VST3, AU and LV2 Plugins. OwlPlug is compatible with all previously installed plugins as long as they are all in a specific root directory, for example `C:/AudioPlugins`. Additional directories can be configured if your plugin setup is fragmented on the filesystem.

After downloading Owlplug, you can still organize (add, move, delete, ...) your plugins with a file explorer or with your favorite DAW without breaking anything.  

## Links management

A Link allows you to create and manage symlinks across your filesystem and plugin directories. With Links, you can access directories anywhere on your filesystem (Hard drive, USB keys, custom directories...) through a single root plugin directory. For example, you can configure a link named *usb-drive* in `C:/AudioPlugins` to target your usb hard drive `D:/myPlugins`. All plugins in `D:/myPlugins` will be accessible using `C:/AudioPlugins/usb-drive`. This feature may be useful for DAW that scans plugins from predefined or limited number directories. On some Windows version, symlinks creation may require admin privileges.

## DAW Projects analysis

OwlPlug can scan DAW projects to extract referenced plugins. Plugins references in project files are compared to plugins installed in configured directories. This way, users can quickly identify missing plugins required to open projects.

The list of compatible DAWs is available in the [documentation](https://github.com/DropSnorz/OwlPlug/wiki/Projects-and-DAW-Support)

## Explore and download Plugins

OwlPlug can be connected to several remote sources to download plugins. A Remote Source (or Registry) is a collection of downloadable plugins that can be installed locally. OwlPlug can be configured to use any compatible third-party source in *Explore* Tab > *Sources* > *Add a new source*.

Here are some recommended compatible sources.

#### OwlPlug Registry ‚≠ê 

OwlPlug official plugin registry for Free or Open Source plugins
* kind: `registry`
* url: `https://registry.owlplug.com/registry.min.json`

#### Open Audio Stack Registry ‚≠ê 

Open Audio Stack registry plugins maintained by community.
* kind: `registry`
* url: `https://open-audio-stack.github.io/open-audio-stack-registry` 

**Discover more plugin sources in [this wiki page](https://github.com/DropSnorz/OwlPlug/wiki/Remote-plugin-sources).**

### How to distribute plugins on OwlPlug?

* **(Recommended)** Distribute your plugins from the [open-audio-stack-registry](https://github.com/open-audio-stack/open-audio-stack-registry).
* Distribute your plugins from the legacy [owlplug-registry](https://github.com/OwlPlug/owlplug-registry).
* Setup and host a custom remote source to distribute multiple plugins, following the [open-audio-stack-registry](https://github.com/open-audio-stack/open-audio-stack-registry) or [owlplug-registry](https://github.com/OwlPlug/owlplug-registry) specification.
