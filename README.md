# OwlPlug


## Overview

OwlPlug is a small audio plugin manager. It provides a complete view of your installed plugins. OwlPlug is compatible with your plugin setup as there are all in a specific root directory. For example `C:/AudioPlugins`. OwlPlug can handle VST2 and VST3 Plugins. 

You can setup repositories to keep your local plugin collection synced with a master source (Local network, google drive, ...). This is really usefull when you have to collaborate or manage different stages (live, studio, and test plugin sets).


In the future, OwlPlug will be shipped with a plugin store to automate plugin download and installation.

**NOTE: Owlplug is currently in alpha stage. It's higly recommended to backup your files before using it.**
